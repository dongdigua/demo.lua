This is the source code for the Lua live demo that is available at
	http://www.lua.org/cgi-bin/demo

It has three parts:
	demo		the CGI script
	demo.html	the HTML page
	demo.lua	the Lua program that runs user programs

The CGI script is a sh script that handles both GET and POST requests.
Empty GET requests return demo.html, which is what you see when you
visit the URL above. Nonempty GET requests fill the text box with one of
the demo programs listed in demo.html. Lua programs in the text box are
run in reply to POST requests via a stock Lua interpreter.

An important concern of the CGI script is security. Pains are taken to avoid
executing scripts outside the cgi-bin directory and to avoid consuming too
much time or memory when runnning user programs.

The Lua program reads and parses the POST input and runs user programs in
a constrained environment, again for security.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to lhf@tecgraf.puc-rio.br .
